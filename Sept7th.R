#Sept 7th workshop session
#working with the Terminal Pane in RStudio
#use terminal to run command lines 
#Macs use zsh as the default 

#go to tools > global options > terminal pane> new terminals open with > Bash (for MAC)
#can open and close a new terminal via the terminal pane. (drop down next to terminal #)
#its good to open a new terminal if things are going wonky, or slowed down
#its sort of like opening a new word document

# in terminal, used command line "pwd"
# This printed the working directory 
# for me it printed: /Users/zoescott/Desktop/Fall 2023_R_Reproducibility_Course/UA_R_Reproducibility_Workshop
#if pwd was to not work, open a new terminal, type command line and then it should work

#if we want to see what is in the folder we have open use command code: "ls"
#prints: MacBook-Pro-2:UA_R_Reproducibility_Workshop zoescott$ ls
#00-workflow.R
#02-analyze.R
#Data
#Data_clean
#Figures_out
#R
#UA_R_Reproducibility_Workshop.Rproj
#-ne 


#if we want to change the directory we use command line: "cd"

#if want help/to know all the command options that i can use type "man ls" in terminal 
#this prints out the manual with all the "- 'letter'" options
